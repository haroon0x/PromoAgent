# PromoAgent Supabase Integration

Supabase is used for duplicate comment tracking in PromoAgent because it's much faster than checking Reddit API (4-6 calls vs 6-15 calls), works better for server deployments with persistent storage, and provides unlimited history tracking with built-in analytics. It's not currently implemented - the agent still uses Reddit API approach as of now.

## Current Status
⚠️ **NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED**

As of now, PromoAgent is using the Reddit API approach for duplicate checking. The Supabase integration is prepared but not active in the main agent workflow.

## API Call Comparison

| Approach | API Calls | Speed | Reliability |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Reddit API** | 6-15 calls | Slower | Depends on Reddit |
| **Supabase** | 4-6 calls | Faster | More reliable |
